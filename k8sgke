1. Connecting to created Cluster:
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials duplicate-cluster --zone europe-west3-c --project able-reef-372206

2. Creating a deployment with image:
    kubectl create deployment hello-world-rest-api --image=in28min/hello-world-rest-api:0.0.1.RELEASE
    
3. Get deployments in the given cluster:
    kubectl get deployment
    
4. Exposing the deployment to the outside world:
    kubectl expose deployment hello-world-rest-api --type=loadbalancer --port=8080
        
5. Get all services in the given cluster:
    kubectl get services
    
6. Watch progress of LoadBalancer external IP to be provided:
    kubectl get services --watch
    
7. Curl to see if external IP is working:
    curl 34.159.69.247:8080
    curl 34.159.69.247:8080/hello-world
    
8. To get a list of events happening in the cluster:
    kubectl get events
    


######
You create a deployment to deploy a micro service:
You create a service to expose the deployment to the outside world.
######

#####
Increasing number of services in my microservice:
#####

9. Scale your  deployment:
    kubectl scale deployment hello-world-rest-api --replicas=3
    
10. View deployments after scale:
     kubectl get deployment

11. Watch if deployment scale is working:
     watch curl http://34.159.69.247:8080/hello-world
        ### if correctly done youll notice three different sources: the are called pods.###
        ### Load is now distributed among the pods###      

12. Get pods: 
     kubectl get pods
     
13. Increase number of nodes in cluster/Cluster resize:
      ### If you want to run 100 or 1000 instances your microservices ###
     gcloud container clusters resize duplicate-cluster --node-pool default-pool --num-nodes=2 --zone=europe-west3-c
